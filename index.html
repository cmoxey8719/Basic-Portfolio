			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<img id="picture" src="assets/images/ChrisMoxey.jpg">

			<p> I graduated from UCF in 2010 with a Bachelor's of Science in Engineering Technology. Since then I have been in the hospitality business working for the longest at TPC Eagle Trace. Originally I started as a bus boy working in the pub, but worked my way up to server. Later I would spread my influence to the outside golf operations, slowly working my way to pro shop assistant.</p>

			<p>Outside of working everyday of the week, I enjoy long walks on the beach, playing golf, rooting on my favorite hockey team and being comical with friends. I tend to tell jokes often to lighten any mood, sometimes its a perfectly one liner or a story I heard from a friend. Also I always enjoy eating good food from all over town. </p>
